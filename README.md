# LocalBites

A web app *in the works* that will utilize

* Laravel 4.2+
* AngularJS
* Grunt ... or Gulp. We'll see :)
* Homestead/Vagrant developement environment
* Whatever other fancy jazz we decide to throw in the mix

## **Drumroll...*
Begin development!

### Install/Setup Homestead Environment

Roughly:
* Install homestead: http://laravel.com/docs/homestead#installation-and-setup
* `cd Project/Path/Homestead && cp Homestead-starter.yaml Homestead.yaml`
* Should only require some self-explanatory minor editing in the `Homestead.yaml`.
* `vagrant up`
* Edit your hosts file
* Browse to http://localbites.dev

I am interested to hear if this works on the first shot.

Note: see wiki pages for more details and poke around the feature/branches to see what is in the works.

Contributions/feedback welcome.
